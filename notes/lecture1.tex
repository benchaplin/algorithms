\subsection{Complexity classes}

\begin{defn}
    {\bf P} is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    {\bf NP} is the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
    Given a graph, does there exist a Hamiltonian cycle? This problem is thought not to be in P,
    but is in NP. This is because no algorithm has been found to determine whether a graph contains a Hamiltonian
    cycle in $O(|V|^k)$ time for any $k \in \N$. However, given a graph and a path, it can be verified
    whether the path is a Hamiltonian cycle in polynomial time.
\end{ex}

\begin{defn}
    {\bf NP-complete} problems are problems in NP which are ``as hard'' as any problem in NP.
\end{defn}
